#CS3733 Team Alpha Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CS3733-TeamAlpha/Project.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/CS3733-TeamAlpha/Project)

This project contains code for Team Alpha's pathfinding project, a project to create a 
simple pathfinding application for public buildings. Project files for an IntelliJ
IDEA project have been uploaded, please use those and don't forget to add obvious
unwanted files (like binaries) to your global gitignore file. Be sure to follow the
code style format set by the project files!

Be wary of the goat, it bites.
